This project is to automate the usual grind in my office work.

Typical work items that test patience are
#  Developer tasks
## fetching get-latest in perforce
## building latest code
## setup of debug environment
## starting / stopping / query service status
#  Release tasks
## downloading build artifacts from build server
## Deployment of MSIs on dev environment
## Autosys release script release
## service monitoring on SIT/UAT environments

Design goals
# It must allow for plug and play parts that can be introduced later
# It has to be light to build and extend

Potential tool sets:
# Python	-- quick prototyping
# C++		-- I know how to code in this
# scala		-- just because I wish to learn it
