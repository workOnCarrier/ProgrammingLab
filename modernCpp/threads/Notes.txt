To make datastructures threadsafe, you need to ensure following things :-
	# Ensure, no thread gains access, while the invariants are broken
	# Avoid race conditions, inherent in the interface, by providing functions complete operations rather than operation steps
	# Pay attentions for behavior in exceptions to ensure invariants are not broken
	# Minimize the opportunities of deadlock, by restricting the scope of locks and avoiding nested locks

Other considerations:
	When one thread is invoking one function in the interface, what other functions are safe to be invoked from other threads?

futures concepts:
	coroutines, active objects, asio -- competing implementations
