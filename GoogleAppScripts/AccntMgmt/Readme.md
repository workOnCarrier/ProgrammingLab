## Vision/Reason of the project
My father is not a very tech savy person. He has a repair shop for tyres. His present use cases are
### Booking-Billing use case [Dec 2015]
 * He maintains a the booking system in paper based books.
 * Each day, he dispatches some of the repaired tyres for customers.
 * Some customers take delivery and some do not take delivery.
 * At the end of the day, he has to tally the receipt, and update the books.
 * This takes significant time and effort.

#### First phase will be to automate this.
I used Google App Scripts, so I can modify the functionality remotely.
